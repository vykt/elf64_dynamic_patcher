1) The function stubs in .plt appear in same order as in rela.plt.

2) ELF64_R_SYM part of r_info of Elf64_Rela shows index of symbol in .dynsym.

3) st_name part of Elf64_Sym of .dynsym symbols is an offset into .dynstr.

4) .dynstr stores strings. it's section index is given by sh_link of .dynsym.



WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW?

-get all function names from rela.plt

-go through each entry in .plt, compare name to one of the ones in rela.plt

	>if they match, add that 'function' to the libc_func array, record its name and 
	 offset.
